# LifeTrackerApp
App to track life total for card games like Magic the Gathering, Flesh and Blood, ect.

I made this app in the process of learning ReactNative and feel it has helped me progress in my ReactNative skills. I wanted to make an app that I could actually
see myself using in real situations that also used the navigation features I learned with my last ReactNative project.

As of right now it is usable as a single player or two player life tracking app.

I plan on adding some more features soon.



This is the screen you are greeted with when the application starts up. Pressing (or tapping) one of the options brings you to its corresponding screen.

Single player mode is used if you are only keeping track of your own life total. Pressing (or tapping) on the left side of the screen will loser the current life total and pressing (or tapping) on the right side will increase the current life total.

The "Reset" button is used when you want to restore the life total to the starting life total (40).

Two player mode is used when you want to keep track of your life total and a friends life total. Like single player mode, pressing (or tapping) on the left side of the screen will loser the current life total and pressing (or tapping) on the right side will increase the current life total.

The "Reset" button is used when you want to restore the life total to the starting life total (40).
