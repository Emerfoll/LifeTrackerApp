# LifeTrackerApp
App to track life total for card games like Magic the Gathering, Flesh and Blood, ect.

I made this app in the process of learning ReactNative and feel it has helped me progress in my ReactNative skills. I wanted to make an app that I could actually
see myself using in real situations that also used the navigation features I learned with my last ReactNative project.

As of right now it is usable as a single player or two player life tracking app.

I plan on adding some more features soon.
